          <h1>The records broken at T20 World Cup 2024</h1>
          <h2>The first T20 World Cup featuring 20 Teams will go down in history for a number of reasons.</h2>
          <p>The <i>ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024</i> was a truly spectacular event - and it went down in the history books for lots of reasons.
            Here we take a closer look at just some of the amazing feats and records broken in West Indies and USA.</p>

            <h1>The finalists</h1>
            <p>With two thus-far unbeaten sides meeting in the final, it was clear that the champion would set a new record for most wins in a tournament. In fact, India and South Africa both finished with eight match wins - with India missing out on a possible victory due to one of their matches (against Canada in the group stage) being a washout.
               <b> India's 176/7</b> in the final, however, was the highest by any team in the final of a Men's T20 World Cup - edging past Australia's 173/2 against New Zealand in 2021.
                And at the age of 37 years and 60 days,<mark> Rohit Sharma became the oldest man to captain a side to T20 World Cup glory</mark>.</p>
